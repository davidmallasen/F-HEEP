## Unreleased
### Changed
- Simplified reconfiguration flow by using vendored-in regtool.py

### Breaking Changes
- Changed the module interface. ``interrupt_o`` was renamed to
  ``global_interrupt_o``. Additionally, the module also exposes pin level
  interrupt signals in addition to the single, globally multiplexed gpio
  interrupt signal. Existing RTL integrating this IP need to adapt the port
  list of their instantiations.
