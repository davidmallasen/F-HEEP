# Set up an IDE

For FW development, `X-HEEP` can be used together with different Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) flavours. Up to now, full support is just provided by [Segger Embedded Studio (SES)](https://www.segger.com/products/development-tools/embedded-studio/editions/risc-v/). This readme guides you through all the needed steps to get SES working and debugging when prototyping `X-HEEP` into the pynq-z2 board.


## SES installation.
The platform was only tested under Linux and version 7.32 of the Embedded Studio for RISC-V. Please, go to the Segger [download center](https://www.segger.com/downloads/embedded-studio/) to get that version. It is assumed that you have already installed the RISC-V compiler and openOCD. If the latter is not true, check the main [Readme](https://github.com/esl-epfl/x-heep) please.

## Configuration

After installing SES, you need to indicate to Segger your Toolchain directory (RISC-V Compiler) as well as your openOCD installation folder. Those need to be specified into `xheep.emProject` file.

For the RISC-V Compiler path, **line 71**:
```
build_toolchain_directory="/home/< user >/tools/riscv/bin"
```
Please, substitute that path to your current path where the RISC-V compiler was installed. Do not forget to target the `bin` folder inside the installation folder of the toolchain.

For the openOCS path, **line 88**:
```
gdb_server_command_line="/home/< user >/tools/openocd/bin/openocd -f &quot;$(ProjectDir)/../../tb/core-v-mini-mcu-pynq-z2-esl-programmer.cfg&quot;"
```
Please, substitute that path to your current path where openOCD was installed. Do not forget to target the `openocd` file inside the `bin` installation folder of openocd.

## Building

Once the paths are set properly, you can open `xheep.emProject` with SES. That will launch SES with one solution already configured, `xheep_ses`, and one project into that solution `helloworld`. Note that this project has already everything configured to run the `helloworld` application of the main repo, i.e. all the source files are linked to the project as well as the `c user include directories` already set up. Moreover, this project is configured to be running (compile, linking, and debug) by using the on-chip linker `sw/linker/link.ld`. If you want to change any of these options, you will need to change the options of the project or the options of the solution. Note that the project is currently set-up to be working on the `Debug_External` configuration. Please, do not move to other configuration when building and/or debugging. Finally, to build the whole project just press `F7` or `Build > Build helloworld`.

The output should be like this:

<p align="left"><img src="../_static/ides/build_screenshot.png" width="600"></p>

Note that on the right part, you have the memory usage based on the linker we have configured. If you do not see this, you can activate that view in `View > Memory Usage`.

## Debugging

Finally, after building (compile and linking), you can directly start debugging by pressing `F5` or also `Target > Connect GDB Server` and `Debug > Go`. You also have the possibility to activate the terminal to see directly into the SES window the printing characters.

The output should be something like this:

<p align="left"><img src="../_static/ides/debug_screenshot.png" width="600"></p>

Note that when debugging and setting breakpoints, please, go one-by-one (one breakpoint at a time). Several breakpoints support will be supported in the following releases.

Further improvements and support will be provided and explain in following releases.
